# youtube-bot
this is a fun little project which uses the Robot class to automatically create youtube subaccounts and click and like videos. But Google has a protection and after a short ammount of time youtube wants my phonenumber :(

This code is the property of Marc-Felix Schmitz. By default this code is not free to use. But if you want to use it in your private projects contact me at mfschmitz1@web.de and depending on what you want to use it for I will decide weather you can or can't use it.
